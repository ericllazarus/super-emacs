## Customizing

*super-emacs* comprises entirely of plain-text Elisp files. Not everyone has the same setup and that means that you can (and may) change these files according to your need. However, if you're the kind of person who regularly pulls updates from upstream, there's a high probability that future improvements may end up resulting in merge conflicts on your local workspace. In order to solve this problem (and according to a suggestion from [@ericllazarus](https://github.com/ericllazarus)), the arrangement now has a redesign providing the user a way to extend their configuration without causing conflicts with future updates. One recommended way of extending *super-emacs* is described below.

All configuration files under [.emacs.d/super-emacs](.emacs.d/super-emacs) with a name starting with `config-` can be extended by creating another file next to it with the same name but ending with a `-custom.el`. For example, if you plan to extend the file [config-packages.el](.emacs.d/super-emacs/config-packages.el), you can create a file with the name `config-packages-custom.el` next to it in order to hold custom configuration. *super-emacs* will load the original file first followed by the custom file (if it exists) in the right order as designed and you will achieve the effect you desire. Whenever there's an update to the original file, there will be no merge conflicts and life would be so much simpler!
